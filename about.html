      <h3>Inserests</h3>
    <p>I have many other interests besides music. I enjoy coding, and I actually coded this whole website. Reading and writing are a lot of fun, and so is drawing. I watch quite a bit of anime, and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a personal favorite of mine.</p>

      <h3>Family</h3>
  <p>My family also plays a big role in my life. My parents are the ones who introduced me to music. Without them, I would never have com to love music as much as I do. My sister is also a big part of my life. We bond together over music and other interests we share.</p>
