    <h2>About Me</h2>

        <h3>Music Experience</h3>
        <p>I have quite a bit of experience playing music. I've played guitar and bass for almost 4 years now. I've played percussion for 3 years, and I've done competitive marching band for 2 seasons. My first season I played bass one, and this current season I play drum set. Besides playing music, I also enjoy listening to music. The Beatles, Green Day, Twenty One Pilots, and Imagine Dragons are a few of my personal favorites. Gustav Holst's Suite for the Planets is also wonderful.</p>

      <h3>Interests</h3>
    <p>I have many other interests besides music. I enjoy coding, and I actually coded this whole website. Reading and writing are a lot of fun, and so is drawing. I watch quite a bit of anime, and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a personal favorite of mine.</p>

      <h3>Family</h3>
  <p>My family also plays a big role in my life. My parents are the ones who introduced me to music. Without them, I would never have com to love music as much as I do. My sister is also a big part of my life. We bond together over music and other interests we share.</p>
