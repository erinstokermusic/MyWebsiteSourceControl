  <h2>Instrument Info</h2>
  <p>This page houses the basic description of every instrument I play, along with a picture. The instruments are grouped by their family. There is also a section dedicated to explaining the technique.</p>

      <div class="grip1">Match Grip:<br>
        <p>Match grip, also called germanic grip, is one of the several ways to hold sticks and mallets. In this grip, the back of your hands should be facing the ceiling, and your hands should be flat.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grip2">French Grip:<br>
        <p>French grip is another technique used to hold sticks and mallets. In this grip, your thumbs are facing the ceiling. It's most common use is on timpani.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grip3">Traditional Grip:<br>
        <p>Traditional grip is one of the hardest grips to learn. Your right hand stays in match grip, but your left hand changes quite a lot. This grip is used for marching snares.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grip4">Steven's Grip:<br>
        <p>Steven's grip is a variant of four mallet grip. It allows you to hold two mallets in each hand, and be able to change the space between them.</p>
      </div>

    </ul>

      <div class="perc1">Drum Set: <br>
        <p>Drum set is one of the most well known percussion instruments. An average kit contains one snare drum, one kick drum, two or three tom drums, a hi-hat, one or two crash cymbals, and one ride cymbal. Playing drum set requires use of all
          four limbs, which is what makes it one of the hardest percussion instruments. The picture is of the kit I use for marching band. It has one snare, one kick, two toms, one hi-hat, one crash, and one ride.</p><br>
      </div>
      <div class="perc2">Timpani:<br>
        <p>Timpani is one of my favorite instruments to play. Also called kettle drums, an average set of timpani is made up of four drums. The drums are labelled 1-4, with 1 being the biggest and 4 being the smallest. The average size of each of the
          drums is as follows: drum 1, 32"; drum 2, 29"; drum 3, 26"; drum 4, 23". To play these drums, you usually use French grip and felt mallets.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="perc3">Xylophone:<br>
        <p>The xylophone is another commonly known instrument. At least, people know the name of it. Xylos are melodic instruments, and they have quite a few keys. The standard range for a xylo is 3.5 octaves, which is 42 keys. You can use a variety
          of mallets on a xylo, but the most common are hard plastic mallets.</p><br><br>
      </div>
      <div class="perc4">Bells:<br>
        <p>The glockenspiel, or bells as they're more commonly known, are another type of melodic instrument. They look like a xylophone, except they're smaller and made of metal. You can use a variety of mallets on bells, including rubber, plastic,
          and brass.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="perc5">Marimba:<br>
        <p>The third melodic percussion instrument on this list is the marimba. Marimbas are my personal favorite keyboard instrument. They have wooden keys, and their average range is 4.3- 5 octaves. Yarn mallets are the most common mallets used on
          a marimba.Though they look like a xylophone, do not refer to them as a "big xylophone". You will anger everyone.</p><br><br>
      </div>
      <div class="perc6"><br>Vibraphone:<br>
        <p>The vibraphone, or vibes, is another personal favorite keyboard of mine. They look like a xylophone with metal keys, and they also have a pedal. This pedal moves a bar of felt, and thus allows the bars to resonate. There are special
          vibraphone mallets that are used to play vibes.</p>
      </div>

  <h3 id="string">String Instruments</h3>

      <div class="string1">Guitar:<br>
        <p>Guitar is a very well known instrument. Most everyone knows what one is. This picture is of my first electric guitar. It's a Peavey Rockmaster, and it's one of my favorite guitars that I own.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="string2">Bass:<br>
        <p>Bass is also a well known instrument. I've been playing bass longer than I've been playing guitar, but not by much. The picture is of my bass. It's a Squire P-Bass, and it's my baby.</p>
