      <h2>Instrument Info</h2>
      <p>This page houses the basic description of every instrument I play, along with a picture. The instruments are grouped by their family. There is also a section dedicated to explaining the vocab and technique.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Match Grip:<img src="" alt=""><br>
        <p>Match grip, also called germanic grip, is one of the several ways to hold sticks and mallets. In this grip, the back od your hand should be facing the ceiling, and your hand should be flat.</p></li>
        <li>French Grip:<img src="" alt=""><br>
        <p>French grip is another technique used to hold sticks and mallets. In this grip, your thumb is facing the ceiling. It's most common use is on timpani.</p></li>
        <li>Traditional Grip:<img src="" alt=""><br>
        <p>Traditional grip is one of the hardest grips to learn. Your right hand stays in match grip, but your left hand changes quite a lot. This grip is used for marching snares.</p></li>

      <h3 id="perc">Percussion Instruments</h3>
      <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
      <ul>
        <li>Drum Set:<img src="DSCF0004.jpg" alt="Picture of Drum Set"><br>
        <p>Drum set is one of the most well known percussion instruments. An average kit contains one snare drum, one kick drum, two or three tom drums, a hi-hat, one or two crash cymbals, and one ride cymbal. Playing drum set requires use of all four limbs, which is what makes it one of the hardest percussion instruments. The picture is of the kit I use for marching band. It has one snare, one kick, two toms, one hi-hat, one crash, and one ride.</p></li>
        <li>Timpani:<img src="" alt=""><br>
        <p>Timpani is one of my favorite instruments to play. Also called kettle drums, an average set of timpani is made up of four drums. The drums are labelled 1-4, with 1 being the biggest and 4 being the smallest. The average size of each of the drums is as follows: drum 1, 32"; drum 2, 29"; drum 3, 26"; drum 4, 23". To play these drums, you usually use French grip and felt mallets.</p></li>
        <li>Xylophone:<img src="" alt=""><br>
        <p>The xylophone is another commonly known instrument. At least, people know the name of it. Xylos are melodic instruments, and they have quite a few keys. The standard range for a xylo is 3.5 octaves, which is 42 keys. You can use a variety of mallets on a xylo, but the most common are hard plastic mallets.</p></li>
        <li>Bells:<img src="" alt=""><br>
        <p>The glockenspiel, or bells as they're more commonly known, are another type of melodic instrument. They look like a xylophone, except they're smaller and made of metal. You can use a variety of mallets on bells, including rubber, plastic, and brass.</p></li>
        <li>Marimba:<img src="" alt=""><br>
        <p>The third melodic percussion instrument on this list is the marimba. Marimbas are my personal favorite keyboard instrument. They have wooden keys, and their average range is 4.3- 5 octaves. Yarn mallets are the most common mallets used on a marimba.Though they look like a xylophone, do not refer to them as a "big xylophone". You will anger everyone.</p></li>
        <li>Vibraphone:<img src="" alt=""><br>
        <p>The vibraphone, or vibes, is another personal favorite keyboard of mine. They look like a xylophone with metal keys, and they also have a pedal. This pedal moves a bar of felt, and thus allows the bars to resonate. There are special vibraphone mallets that are used to play vibes.</p></li>
